          <p>
            Hi, I'm Oscarâ€”a passionate software developer driven by curiosity
            and innovation. My journey began with AI and emerging tech, and has
            grown to include cybersecurity and secure software development. I
            love learning, taking on diverse projects, and continuously
            expanding my skills across the tech landscape. I'm especially
            motivated by the opportunity to solve real-world problems through
            technology. Collaboration and adaptability are at the core of how I
            work and grow.
