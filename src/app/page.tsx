            I am a junior studying Computer Science at Central Washington
            University with a strong passion for software engineering. I have
            completed three internships, where I gained valuable experience in
            mobile app development, taking projects from concept to final
            product. My primary tools include React Native, Expo, Node.js,
            NextJS, and Firebase, which I use to build custom iOS, Android, and
            web applications.
