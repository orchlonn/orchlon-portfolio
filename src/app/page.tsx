          I am a junior studying Computer Science at Central Washington
          University with a strong passion for software engineering. I have
          completed three internships, where I gained valuable experience in
          mobile app development, taking projects from concept to final product.
          My primary tools include React Native, Expo, Node.js, NextJS, and
          Firebase, which I use to build custom iOS, Android, and web
          applications.
